# Noteworthy
## Objective:
### 
I often bookmark articles that I like but wanted a better way to organize them and add notes.  This website does that as well as preserve the text in the event the article is deleted or edited.
## Getting Started:
* [Deployed App](https://noteworthy-notes.herokuapp.com/)
* [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/jcpZax3f/article-tracker)
### Instructions: 
After creating an account, add an article along with any notes to reference later.
